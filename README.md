# JavaScript Fundamentals Project 🚀

Welcome to the **JavaScript Fundamentals** project!  
This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript exercises that cover basic concepts like command-line arguments, loops, conditionals, and string operations — all written in Node.js.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each script is designed to handle a specific concept or problem using pure JavaScript. The scripts are named based on their purpose and problem number.

## 📜 Included Scripts & Descriptions

| File                      | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `2-arguments.js`          | Prints a message based on the number of command-line arguments passed (`"No argument"`, `"Argument found"`, or `"Arguments found"`). |
| `3-value_argument.js`     | Prints the **first** argument passed to the script, or `"No argument"` if none is passed. |
| `4-concat.js`             | Prints two arguments in the format: `<arg1> is <arg2>`, with fallback to `undefined` when an argument is missing. |
| `6-multi_languages_loop.js` | Uses an array and loop to print multiple lines like `"C is fun"`, `"Python is cool"`, etc., using a single `console.log` inside a loop. |
| `factorial.js` (optional) | Computes the factorial of a number passed as an argument using recursion, with validation. |
| `print-square.js` (optional) | Prints a square made of `X` characters based on a numeric argument. |

## 💡 Concepts Covered

- Command-line arguments using `process.argv`
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`)
- String methods (`repeat`)
- Type conversion (`Number`, `isNaN`)
- Recursion (in factorial)
- Input validation

## ✅ How to Run the Scripts

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

To run a script:
```bash
node <filename.js> [arguments]
